/*
The velocity of a satellite circling around the Earth is computed by the
formula
    
where M_E  5.98 X 10^24 kg is the mass of the Earth, r the distance from the
center of the Earth to the satellite in meters, and G  6.67 X 10^11 m^3/kg.s^2
the universal gravitational constant. The unit of the velocity v is m/s. Write a
program that inputs the radius r and outputs the satelliteâ€™s velocity. Confirm
that a satellite that is closer to the Earth travels faster. Define symbolic
constants for M_E and G. The distance to the Hubble Space Telescope from
the center of the Earth, for example, is approximately 6.98X10^6 m.
