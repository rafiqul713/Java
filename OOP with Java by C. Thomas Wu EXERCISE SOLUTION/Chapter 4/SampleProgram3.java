/*
Write a program that displays the recommended weight (kg), given the
userâ€™s age and height (cm). The formula for calculating the recommended
weight is recommendedWeight = (height - 100 + age / 10) * 0.90
Define a service class named Height and include an appropriate method for
getting a recommended weight of a designated height.
